Something about

My fist game was made 2 years ago and it was Flappy Bird. It took me approximately 7 hours. 
I downloaded graphics from the internet, because then I didn't knew how to make something like a Pixel-Art (and graphics completely). I had only
5 months of programming experience.

Yesterday (02/08/2022) I made it within 3 hours and with my own made Pixel Art. Pixel Art from original game was taken as a reference. 
Programming was easy now when I got 2+ years of experience. I knew what I was doing.


(3 Hours are counting since my first tep (Graphics) to my last step (Gameplay Balance))
